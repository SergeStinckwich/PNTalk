Only a simple demo of how it could work. Requires Unix/Linux with LaTeX, xpdf, wmctrl and SM packages OSProcess, CommandShell. When a LaTeX source is saved, LaTeX compiler is invoked and viewer opened. Eps figures or other files can be attached (menu -> import). All sources are stored in image, host OS files are used only temporarily.

If something does not work properly, remove the temporary directories /tmp/LatexDocumentTMP*.
