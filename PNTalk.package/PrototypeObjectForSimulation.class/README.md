My copies are deep copies. Only references to globals (objects in MyRepository) are shared.

TO DO. Up to now, this is only a placeholder.

TO DO: 
- implement copy (like in AtomicDEVSPrototype>>postCopy) and make PrototypeObjectWithSharedAtomicBehavior subclass me.
- AtomicDEVSPrototype refactoring (sources need not to be maintained when inheriting from PrototypeObjectWithSources)
